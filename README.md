# eb_utilities
a repo for some useful scripts created in the last years

All the folders are organized separately for the 2 main programming languages that I am the most proficient in: MATLAB and python.

The subfolders have *hopefully* self-explanatory names that should clarify what the scripts are about.
Some code has better documentation, and it is well suited to be readapted in other contexts.
Other pieces of code were created for specific contexts (e.g. experiemnts), and, albeit having modular, reusable components, might require some drivethrough.

Please contact me at elio.balestrieri@gmail.com for any question!
